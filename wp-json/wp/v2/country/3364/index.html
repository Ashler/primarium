These resources are made available on the website of the General Directorate of Basic Education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Handwriting education is addressed mainly in the&nbsp;<em>T\u00fcrk\u00e7e Dersi\u0307 \u00d6\u011freti\u0307m Programi,<\/em>&nbsp;or Turkish Educational Program, which was published by the MEB in 2019. It outlines that students should begin learning handwriting in Grade 1, starting with motor skills involving basic strokes, followed by uppercase and then lowercase letters. The program illustrates the prescribed handwriting model for this, known as&nbsp;<em>dik temel yaz\u0131<\/em>, or basic vertical writing.&nbsp;<em>Dik temel yaz\u0131<\/em>&nbsp;consists of upright, unjoined letters in a geometric style, which are based on \u201cball and stick\u201d models. Additionally, the document provides information about correct posture and the way to hold the pencil. Finally, it mentions that cursive writing can be optionally taught from Grade 3, however no cursive handwriting model is suggested.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MEB publishes three volumes of a handwriting textbook based on this approach called&nbsp;<em>\u0130lk Okuma Ve Yazma \u00c7ali\u015fma Ki\u0307tabi<\/em>&nbsp;(2020), or&nbsp;<em>First Read and Write Workbook<\/em>, by Akile AVCI, Berna Arg\u00fcn and G\u00fcldeniz \u00c7elik. These are used in most Turkish schools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The method of handwriting instruction described above came into effect in 2017. It replaced the French model of \u201ccursive first\u201d handwriting education that was introduced in 2005.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Discontinuation of cursive first instruction<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dik temel yaz\u0131<\/em>&nbsp;was officially implemented in Turkish primary schools in 2017, breaking away with the years-long tradition of cursive handwriting education. This may appear an abrupt change of government policy in the area of literacy, but it is hardly the first one or the most important. In 1928, after the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish War of Independence, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s government undertook a series of important reforms in the country. One of them was the adoption of the Latin alphabet, and a stop to the use of the Ottoman Turkish alphabet, a variant of Arabic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"724\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/02_NKS-TTKB-DikTemelAbece-TypeSpecimen_A3-HR-1024x724.webp\" alt=\"Type specimen of TTKB Dik Temel Abece (courtesy of Prof. Nam\u0131k Kemal Sarikavak)\" class=\"wp-image-3590\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/02_NKS-TTKB-DikTemelAbece-TypeSpecimen_A3-HR-1024x724.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/02_NKS-TTKB-DikTemelAbece-TypeSpecimen_A3-HR-300x212.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/02_NKS-TTKB-DikTemelAbece-TypeSpecimen_A3-HR-768x543.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/02_NKS-TTKB-DikTemelAbece-TypeSpecimen_A3-HR.webp 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Type specimen of TTKB Dik Temel Abece (courtesy of Prof. Nam\u0131k Kemal Sarikavak)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The selection of Latin and subsequent literacy efforts were an attempt to distance Turkey from Arabic and its inherent relationship with Islam, and to bring it closer to Europe instead, which was viewed as more modern. As a result, the usage of writing models that traced their origins to Europe and were fashionable in the West was a natural step. Palmer Business Writing, Zaner-Bloser, and later, D\u2019Nealian were all favoured in Turkey. The latter two advocated for their simultaneous teaching of cursive and a variant of unjoined letters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Different styles of sloped continuous cursive writing were part of primary school education for nearly all of Turkey\u2019s history. According to Prof. Nam\u0131k Kemal Sarikavak of Hacettepe University, in the 1980s there was a visible decline in handwriting for a range of reasons: from social and political developments to the influence of technology, in particular typing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"786\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/03_Turkce-Egitimi-Yazi-Dersi-Ogretim-Programi_2482-1997-1024x786.webp\" alt=\"Sloped continuous cursive style presented as part of the Elementary School Turkish Education Writing Course Curriculum (MEB, 1997)\" class=\"wp-image-3591\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/03_Turkce-Egitimi-Yazi-Dersi-Ogretim-Programi_2482-1997-1024x786.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/03_Turkce-Egitimi-Yazi-Dersi-Ogretim-Programi_2482-1997-300x230.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/03_Turkce-Egitimi-Yazi-Dersi-Ogretim-Programi_2482-1997-768x589.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/03_Turkce-Egitimi-Yazi-Dersi-Ogretim-Programi_2482-1997.webp 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Sloped continuous cursive style presented as part of the Elementary School Turkish Education Writing Course Curriculum (MEB, 1997)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2005, the Turkish government adopted the&nbsp;<em>cursive first<\/em>&nbsp;model of instruction that had been successfully employed in France and parts of North America. This method proposed that students learn only cursive handwriting, as opposite to transitioning from print to cursive letters in second or third grade. The decision was taken without public consultation, and it faced criticism and complaints from students, parents and especially teachers, who were unprepared for such change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After twelve years, the MEB repealed&nbsp;<em>cursive first<\/em>&nbsp;handwriting education and recommended teaching unjoined vertical letters instead. This decision was taken after public polls that showed that 99.3% participants were against cursive writing instruction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"630\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"3592\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/04_Turkey-MEB_workbook5-630x1024.webp\" alt=\"Turkey, MEB primer\" class=\"wp-image-3592\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/04_Turkey-MEB_workbook5-630x1024.webp 630w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/04_Turkey-MEB_workbook5-185x300.webp 185w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/04_Turkey-MEB_workbook5-768x1247.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/04_Turkey-MEB_workbook5-946x1536.webp 946w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/04_Turkey-MEB_workbook5-1261x2048.webp 1261w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/04_Turkey-MEB_workbook5.webp 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"630\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"3593\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/05_Turkey-MEB_workbook4-630x1024.webp\" alt=\"Turkey, MEB primer\" class=\"wp-image-3593\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/05_Turkey-MEB_workbook4-630x1024.webp 630w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/05_Turkey-MEB_workbook4-185x300.webp 185w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/05_Turkey-MEB_workbook4-768x1247.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/05_Turkey-MEB_workbook4-946x1536.webp 946w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/05_Turkey-MEB_workbook4-1261x2048.webp 1261w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/05_Turkey-MEB_workbook4.webp 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" \/><\/figure>\n<figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">The material published by the MEB uses unjoined geometric letters (Avci, 2020)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"template":"","acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/country\/3364"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/country"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/country"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3364"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
