This includes the development of the national curriculum, approval of textbooks, and the introduction of pedagogical standards and regulations. The <em>Ministarstvo<\/em> also establishes educational institutions and ensures that they are run in accordance to the country\u2019s laws regarding education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Croatia, education is almost entirely public, and as of 2007, the government stopped co-financing private schools. The system is divided into four levels: preschool, which is available for children from six months until school age; elementary school, which starts at age 6 or 7 and lasts for 8 years; followed by secondary school and higher education. Of these, only elementary school is compulsory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The education system places a strong emphasis on language, recognising the vital role it plays in cultural preservation and communication. The government has taken several steps to protect and foster Croatian, the official language in educational institutions, while also acknowledging the importance of ethnic and regional minority tongues, and promoting foreign language education, which has been compulsory in primary schools since 2003. In areas where ethnic minorities comprise a majority of the population, the minority language is recognised as the second official language.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"288\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Cursive-Handwriting-Croatia-1024x288.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4874\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Cursive-Handwriting-Croatia-1024x288.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Cursive-Handwriting-Croatia-300x84.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Cursive-Handwriting-Croatia-768x216.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Cursive-Handwriting-Croatia.webp 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Cursive handwriting model standardized for Croatian primary schools since 2013.

In first grade, students match letters with sounds, and learn to recognise them in the context of words. This is done using simplified print letters, which are also the first shapes they learn to write. Uppercase and lowercase letters are learned simultaneously. In second grade, students must write using <em>rukopisno pismo<\/em>, or school handwriting, which is a continuous and fully joined cursive, with short and looped ascenders and descenders. This model is specified in the weekly work plan provided by the <em>Ministarstvo<\/em> for implementing its curriculum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Standardising models for handwriting instruction<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, handwriting in Croatia has been influenced by two foreign models. The first was English Roundhand, which was prevalent in England and elsewhere in Europe at the turn of the last century. The second was <em>Schulausgangsschrift<\/em> from Eastern Germany (DDR). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"693\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/English-Roundhand-Script-1024x693.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4877\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/English-Roundhand-Script-1024x693.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/English-Roundhand-Script-300x203.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/English-Roundhand-Script-768x520.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/English-Roundhand-Script.webp 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">English Roundhand Script popular in the 19th century<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"723\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Schulausgangschrift-1-723x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4879\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Schulausgangschrift-1-723x1024.webp 723w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Schulausgangschrift-1-212x300.webp 212w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Schulausgangschrift-1-768x1087.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Schulausgangschrift-1.webp 989w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Schulausgangsschrift<\/em> (1968) from Eastern Germany<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1970, educator Edo Vajnaht proposed his school script that was used in Croatia until recently, and it bore notable similarities to <em>Schulausgangsschrift<\/em>, which was introduced two years prior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"736\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Edo-Vajnaht-School-Script-1970-1024x736.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4881\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Edo-Vajnaht-School-Script-1970-1024x736.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Edo-Vajnaht-School-Script-1970-300x216.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Edo-Vajnaht-School-Script-1970-768x552.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Edo-Vajnaht-School-Script-1970.webp 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Sample of cursive handwriting from <em>Na\u0161 put : po\u010detnica za 1. razred osnovne \u0161kole<\/em>, Edo Vajnaht, 1970, Zagreb.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Until 2013, the situation of handwriting instruction was described by Professor Sini\u0161a Reberski as \u201cchaotic\u201d.
