Regional authorities also select, approve, purchase and distribute textbooks and other learning materials to schools. While education is generally compulsory from ages 6\u20137 to 16 years old, some provinces choose to make it mandatory from pre-school onwards, or extend it until students turn 18 years old.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two official languages: English and French. Most schools have English as the main language of instruction, however in most provinces and territories, it is possible to choose francophone or bilingual schools. In Quebec, the language of instruction in elementary school is French.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Canada_pangram.svg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"786\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Canada_pangram.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3881\"\/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Sample of Zaner-Bloser style font. <em>Schoolhouse Educational Handwriting Fonts,<\/em> vLetter.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Handwriting education is usually a multi-stage process that begins in the first grade (6\u20137 years old). Students start with uppercase letters in print script style (locally known as \u201cmanuscript\u201d or \u201cprinting\u201d). Cursive writing is taught either in the late second grade (7\u20138 years old) or in the third grade (8\u20139 years old). The system closely resembles what is followed in many schools in the United States. Although the general practice is to teach both print script and cursive in Canada, this may vary by region, school or teacher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the 20th century, the advantages and disadvantages of teaching print script and cursive writing were hotly debated in Canada. Owing to issues of motor complexity and the cognitive load on students in learning two distinct styles, print script prevailed in most regions in the 1990s and cursive writing fell out of favour. Even today, writing is viewed largely from the perspective of text production and communication, and recommendations about letter shapes are limited to comments regarding legibility and character recognition. Consequently, curricula and related resources do not provide directions about using specific styles for handwriting instruction. In recent years, this state of affairs has come to be scrutinised by authorities and schools. There have been failing handwriting standards and a decline in the quality of written production by students. Since the 2010s, there has also been a global push towards cursive writing by neurocognition experts, and its strong influence continues to be felt in Canada. Consequently, some provinces have reinstated cursive writing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In seven provinces \u2014 Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island \u2014 cursive writing is a mandatory requirement between third (8\u20139 years old) and sixth grades (11-12 years old). While in British Columbia, Ontario, and Newfoundland and Labrador, teaching cursive writing is not mandatory, though teachers may choose to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Ontario-cursive-model-1981.webp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"868\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Ontario-cursive-model-1981-868x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3883\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Ontario-cursive-model-1981-868x1024.webp 868w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Ontario-cursive-model-1981-254x300.webp 254w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Ontario-cursive-model-1981-768x906.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Ontario-cursive-model-1981-1302x1536.webp 1302w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Ontario-cursive-model-1981-1736x2048.webp 1736w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Sample of a typical school model of cursive letters in Ontario schools.

It was developed by educator Henry Boyver MacLean (1884\u20131976), between the 1920s and 1960s in Victoria. Building on letter shapes devised by Austin Norman Palmer (1860\u20131927) in the United States, MacLean introduced several adaptations to suit the needs of school instruction, such as modifications to teaching methods and addition of motor preparation exercises. By the 1960s, he also incorporated American print script style into his system to serve as the first letters introduced to students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Maclean-Method.webp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"908\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Maclean-Method-908x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3885\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Maclean-Method-908x1024.webp 908w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Maclean-Method-266x300.webp 266w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Maclean-Method-768x867.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Maclean-Method-1361x1536.webp 1361w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Maclean-Method.webp 1815w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Sample of lowercase alphabets of Canada&#8217;s most used handwriting teaching method during the 20th century: <em>The MacLean Method of Printing &amp; Writing<\/em>.
