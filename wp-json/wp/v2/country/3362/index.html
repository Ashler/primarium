It sets out broad policy guidelines, while its Centre for Curriculum Development and General Methodology of Education handles all curriculum research and development. Vietnamese is the national language, and written in the Latin script. The Vietnamese alphabet is known as <em>Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef<\/em> locally, and accents are used to represent tones in the language. Since 2008, English is also a compulsory subject from Grade 3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Children start with preschool (3 months\u20136 years old) followed by primary education comprising Grade 1\u20135 (6\u201310 years old), and then lower secondary, comprising Grade 6\u20139 (11\u201314 years old), and finally upper secondary, comprising Grade 10\u201312 (15\u201317 years old). Of these, primary education is free and compulsory, and students are obligated to attend school till the end of lower secondary. Schools are primarily state-funded and public, though private schools also exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ministry publishes the General Education Curriculum, which must be followed by all schools, whether public or private. The last iteration was released in 2018, with the goal of being implemented in primary schools by 2020-21.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"5793\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Upright-UC-Mono-700x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5793\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Upright-UC-Mono-700x1024.webp 700w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Upright-UC-Mono-205x300.webp 205w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Upright-UC-Mono-768x1124.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Upright-UC-Mono-1049x1536.webp 1049w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Upright-UC-Mono.webp 1399w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"5792\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Upright-LC-Mono-700x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5792\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Upright-LC-Mono-700x1024.webp 700w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Upright-LC-Mono-205x300.webp 205w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Upright-LC-Mono-768x1123.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Upright-LC-Mono-1050x1536.webp 1050w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Upright-LC-Mono.webp 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/figure>\n<figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">Samples of upright letters <em>M\u1eabu ch\u1eef th\u1ea3o ti\u1ebfng vi\u1ec7t<\/em>, or Vietnamese official cursive script, that were adopted in 2002-03.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>An official handwriting model for teaching in primary schools was adopted in 2002 through Decision 31\/2002\/Q\u0110-BGD&amp;\u0110T. It is called the <em>m\u1eabu ch\u1eef th\u1ea3o ti\u1ebfng vi\u1ec7t<\/em>, or Vietnamese official cursive script, and has been in use from academic year 2002-03 onwards. Like the curriculum, it must be followed across the country. Based on this model, students learn to write in both upright and (optionally) sloped cursive letters, without ever being taught print script letters. However, they do practice drawing the basic strokes that make up letters in preparation. Handwriting education happens between Grades 1 to 3, and while students are introduced to writing using a pencil, they graduate to writing with fountain pens while they are still in primary school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"5795\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Slanted-UC-Mono-700x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5795\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Slanted-UC-Mono-700x1024.webp 700w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Slanted-UC-Mono-205x300.webp 205w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Slanted-UC-Mono-768x1123.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Slanted-UC-Mono-1050x1536.webp 1050w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Slanted-UC-Mono.webp 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"5794\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Slanted-LC-Mono-700x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5794\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Slanted-LC-Mono-700x1024.webp 700w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Slanted-LC-Mono-205x300.webp 205w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Slanted-LC-Mono-768x1123.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Slanted-LC-Mono-1050x1536.webp 1050w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Vietnam_Slanted-LC-Mono.webp 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/figure>\n<figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">Samples of sloped letters <em>M\u1eabu ch\u1eef th\u1ea3o ti\u1ebfng vi\u1ec7t<\/em>, or Vietnamese official cursive script, that were adopted in 2002-03.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Good cursive handwriting has been considered very important in Vietnamese culture. Students are known to prioritise developing it as a prized skill, and handwriting competitions for school students have enjoyed a great degree of prestige in the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef<\/em> script, a Latin orthography based on the French alphabet, was introduced as a writing system for Vietnamese in the 17th century. It was developed by French Jesuit Alexandre de Rhodes and Portuguese missionaries, Francisco de Pina, Gaaspar do Amaral, and Antonio Barbosa. Previously, Vietnamese had been written using two logographic writing systems: <em>Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n<\/em> and <em>Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m<\/em>, a result of the region\u2019s Chinese occupation. In 1869, French authorities made <em>Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef<\/em> script compulsory for administrative documents to use this new script.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lettering and handwriting books focused on the <em>Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef<\/em> script, published in the 20th century before the reunification of Vietnam, had clear European influences. A 1923 teacher\u2019s handbook by Thanh T\u00f9ng, for instance, showcased the Latin alphabet in Copperplate style, which originated in England. It should also be noted that upon independence from France in 1945, the country inherited an education system that was modelled after its French counterpart. And while the system has been overhauled since, its impact can still be seen in the prevalent handwriting model taught in schools today, which is a narrow, upright cursive with decorative uppercase, not dissimilar in style to the French <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/handwriting-models\/methode-dumont\/\">M\u00e9thode Dumont<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"756\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Hoc-Van_1976-1024x756.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5796\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Hoc-Van_1976-1024x756.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Hoc-Van_1976-300x221.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Hoc-Van_1976-768x567.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Hoc-Van_1976.webp 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Sample of cursive writing with contrast from <em>H\u1ecdc V\u1ea7n <\/em>(1976), textbook published by Nh\u00e0 Xu\u00e3t B\u1ea3n Gi\u00e1o D\u1ee5c Giai Ph\u00f3ng. <a href=\"https:\/\/thuongmaitruongxua.vn\/sach\/giai-doan-1976-1979\/doc-sach\/hoc-van.html#page1\">https:\/\/thuongmaitruongxua.vn\/sach\/giai-doan-1976-1979\/doc-sach\/hoc-van.html#page1<\/a>.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The current model is the result of successive reforms in education, starting from 1981.
