While the Federal Ministry of Education, regulates and ensures its overall quality, local authorities manage the implementation of state-controlled policies regarding public education and state schools. The Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) monitors the country\u2019s primary education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The education system is divided into\u00a0kindergarten or pre-primary (5 years old), primary education (6\u201312 years old), secondary education, divided into lower (12\u201315 years old) and upper levels (15\u201318 years old), and\u00a0tertiary education. Pre-primary, primary and lower secondary education are together known as \u201cbasic education\u201d, and are compulsory. Despite the mandate for compulsory basic education, school enrolment remains low in Nigeria. Both public and private schools exist, with public education funded by the government, emphasising accessibility, while private institutions operate on different financial models.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"718\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-1024x718.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6724\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-1024x718.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-300x210.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-768x538.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-1536x1076.webp 1536w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-2048x1435.webp 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Samples of student handwriting exercises, based on the British <em>Nelson Handwriting<\/em> model, in private schools.

It places emphasis on literacy in the early years of education. In 2000, the National Reading Panel placed writing as a transversal skill, intertwined with phonics and spelling. While no specific guidelines or models for handwriting are specified in the curriculum, by the third year of primary education, students are expected to recognise and understand the use of uppercase letters and punctuation marks, as well as copy passage in clear, legible handwriting that has proper inter-letter and inter-word spacing. In the absence of clear directions, students mostly end up mimicking the handwriting style of their teachers and parents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"785\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"6725\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-785x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6725\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-785x1024.webp 785w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-230x300.webp 230w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-768x1001.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-1178x1536.webp 1178w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-1571x2048.webp 1571w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-scaled.webp 1963w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"690\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"6726\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/03_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-690x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6726\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/03_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-690x1024.webp 690w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/03_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-202x300.webp 202w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/03_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-768x1140.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/03_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-1035x1536.webp 1035w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/03_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-1379x2048.webp 1379w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/03_Nigeria-Nelson-Handwriting-Sample-scaled.webp 1724w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" \/><\/figure>\n<figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">Samples of student handwriting exercises, based on the British <em>Nelson Handwriting<\/em> model, in private schools. Courtesy of Adebike Adenuga, 2023.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In Nigeria, there is an emphasis on students receiving instruction in the language they hear and use every day. This poses a challenge in a country with limited resources and great linguistic diversity. Apart from four widely spoken languages \u2014 Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba and English \u2014 there are hundreds of regional languages as well as dialects. As a result teacher training and educational resources are required for several languages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Role of book publishers &amp; aid organisations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>International book publishers and aid organisations play a prominent role in shaping handwriting education in Nigeria.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Books from major publishing houses such as University Press plc (formerly Oxford University Press Nigeria, founded 1949), Longman Nigeria plc, Macmillan Nigeria Publishers Ltd, and Evans Brothers (Nigeria Publishers) Ltd, strengthen British influence, which already exists as a result of colonisation. Their books, usually targeted towards private schools, commonly feature Nelson\u2019s Handwriting, a progressive, three-step approach to handwriting instruction, originally developed by Alexander Inglis, Edward H. Gibson, and Douglas M. McIntosh in 1962. It should also be noted that this method is published by the Oxford University Press today. There are also independent Nigerian publishers, such as Adebike Adenuga, Yusuf Owolabi and Sunday Abbah, that contribute to this landscape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"724\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"6727\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Charisville-Handwriting-724x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6727\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Charisville-Handwriting-724x1024.webp 724w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Charisville-Handwriting-212x300.webp 212w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Charisville-Handwriting-768x1086.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Charisville-Handwriting-1086x1536.webp 1086w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Charisville-Handwriting-1448x2048.webp 1448w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Charisville-Handwriting.webp 1754w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"724\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"6728\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Charisville-Handwriting-724x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6728\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Charisville-Handwriting-724x1024.webp 724w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Charisville-Handwriting-212x300.webp 212w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Charisville-Handwriting-768x1086.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Charisville-Handwriting-1086x1536.webp 1086w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Charisville-Handwriting-1448x2048.webp 1448w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Charisville-Handwriting.webp 1754w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px\" \/><\/figure>\n<figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">Sample pages with alphabets based on Nelson Handwriting, from <em>Creative Handwriting<\/em> worksheets for ages 2-5.

Today while private schools, with more resources, may adopt foreign models like Nelson Handwriting, public schools face financial constraints, impacting their ability to prioritise handwriting education. Given these circumstances, the handwriting style learned by students is often influenced by the habits of their parents and teachers, and they end up mimicking what they see around them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"721\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"6716\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Mu-Karanta_2019-721x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6716\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Mu-Karanta_2019-721x1024.webp 721w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Mu-Karanta_2019-211x300.webp 211w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Mu-Karanta_2019-768x1091.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Mu-Karanta_2019-1081x1536.webp 1081w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Mu-Karanta_2019-1442x2048.webp 1442w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/01_Mu-Karanta_2019-scaled.webp 1802w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"721\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"6717\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Mu-Karanta_2019-721x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6717\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Mu-Karanta_2019-721x1024.webp 721w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Mu-Karanta_2019-211x300.webp 211w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Mu-Karanta_2019-768x1091.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Mu-Karanta_2019-1081x1536.webp 1081w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Mu-Karanta_2019-1442x2048.webp 1442w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/02_Mu-Karanta_2019-scaled.webp 1802w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px\" \/><\/figure>\n<figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">Handwriting exercises based on a print script with <em>Andika<\/em> font.
