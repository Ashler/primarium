The same department also provides a free handwriting teaching resource called <em>QCursive<\/em>, which includes <em>QCursive<\/em> fonts that are based on this model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students are introduced to the pattern-making and upper and lowercase letterforms on lined and blank paper in Year 1 (7\u20138 years old); next they are introduced to ligatures for joining for developing cursive writing in Year 2 (8\u20139 years old); in Year 3 (9\u201310 years old), students continue to write in cursive and use pen-lifts; and finally during Years 4\u20137 (10\u201313 years old), students can optionally incorporate flourished uppercase letters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The foundational form of the lowercase letters is a slanted oval. The connecting strokes between letters are diagonal. Only the letter \u201cf\u201d features an ascender loop, and while speed loops are accepted as a consequence of fast writing, they are not taught to students. It should be noted that in this model, letter \u201cd\u201d is drawn with an exit stroke even in the \u201cbeginner\u2019s alphabet\u201d while the \u201ca\u201d is not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"3680\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/infographic-Australia_queensland.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5432\"\/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":5180,"template":"","acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/models\/5019"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/models"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/models"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/5180"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5019"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
