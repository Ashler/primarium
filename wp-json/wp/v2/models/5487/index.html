The system contains a variety of resources, both digital and printed, and features a progressive teaching model that starts with patterns, then simple letters, ending with precursive and cursive writing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Key Stage 1 level, i.e. Years 1 and 2, students (5-7 years old) are introduced to simple print letters and numbers, and by lower Key Stage 2, i.e. Years 3 and 4 (7-9 years old),&nbsp;they are expected to use joined handwriting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1266\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/England_Letter-join_pangram.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5488\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Letter-join has simple capital uppercase and round, fully-joined lowercase letters.
