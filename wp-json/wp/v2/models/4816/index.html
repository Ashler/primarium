The original design was developed in 1996, and a commercial version called <em>B\u00ea-a-b\u00e1<\/em>, featuring subtle changes in some letterforms, was released in 2015 by De Marco\u2019s type foundry, Just in Type (previously Tipomovel). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the foundry website, <em>Kindergarten<\/em> has undergone continuous development and improvement from the time of its creation, and has been customised for several publishers and institutions, such as Editora Moderna, FTD, Saraiva, \u00c1tica, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Bradesco, and Col\u00e9gio Dante Alighieri. A popular example of <em>Kindergarten<\/em> in use is the Porta Aberta collection by FTD. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Kindergarten <\/em>follows<em> <\/em>a<em> <\/em>continuous cursive style with loops and no slant. Its uppercase letters have some decorative features, and an abundance of knots that results in complex shapes in some cases. The spurless shapes of lower case a, q and g, the single looped f and the symmetrical l are some of its most recognisable features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"4085\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/infographic-Brazil_kindergarten-1.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5173\"\/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":4817,"template":"","acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/models\/4816"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/models"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/models"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/4817"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4816"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
