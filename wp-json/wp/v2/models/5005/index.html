SA follows a progressive system that begins with simplified print style letters called \u201cbeginner\u2019s alphabet\u201d that are then joined to become the <em>South Australian Modern Cursive<\/em> style. Even though the department made the typeface <em>SA Modern Cursive<\/em> available in 2006, handwriting can be taught using any font that follows modern cursive conventions.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\" scrolling-wrapper \">\n  <div\n    class=\"wp-block-gallery gallery--scrolling js-scrolling-box\">\n    <div\n      class=\"gallery-scroll-wrapper js-scrolling-elements\">\n            <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/08-South-Australia-Handwriting-Curriculum2.webp\" class=\"wp-block-image scrolling__img\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/08-South-Australia-Handwriting-Curriculum2.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/08-South-Australia-Handwriting-Curriculum2-219x300.webp 219w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/08-South-Australia-Handwriting-Curriculum2-749x1024.webp 749w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/08-South-Australia-Handwriting-Curriculum2-768x1050.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/>            <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1400\" height=\"987\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/08-South-Australia-Handwriting-Curriculum.webp\" class=\"wp-block-image scrolling__img\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/08-South-Australia-Handwriting-Curriculum.webp 1400w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/08-South-Australia-Handwriting-Curriculum-300x212.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/08-South-Australia-Handwriting-Curriculum-1024x722.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/08-South-Australia-Handwriting-Curriculum-768x541.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" \/>          <\/div>\n\n\n    <span class=\"gallery__arrows stacked-box\">\n      <svg class=\"g__bg\">\n\n        <use xlink:href=\"#blob-bg1\" \/>\n      <\/svg>\n      <svg class=\"g__arrow1\">\n        <use xlink:href=\"#drag\" \/>\n      <\/svg>\n\n    <\/span>\n  <\/div>\n  <figcaption\n    class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption gallery__caption\">\n    <p>Excerpts from <em><span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"1\">Handwriting in the South Australian Curriculum<\/span><\/em>, showing how simplified print letters are transformed into joined ones.<\/p>\n  <\/figcaption>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>After students learn to write simplified print letters in lowercase and uppercase, they are taught how to make exit strokes in letters in Year 2 (7\u20138 years old), and once they start showing signs of joining letters, proper linking techniques are taught from the beginning of Year 3 (8\u20139 years old). In middle school, students may be introduced to similar handwriting models and different writing tools for experimentation, and are encouraged to develop their personal handwriting style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lowercase letters are based on the foundation of a lightly sloped oval and the extenders are medium length. A distinguishing feature of the <em>South Australian Modern Cursive<\/em> is its lack of loops. Uppercase letters follow print style conventions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach to handwriting is also used in some schools in Western Australia (WA).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"4480\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/infographic-Australia_south-australia.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5506\"\/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":5177,"template":"","acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/models\/5005"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/models"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/models"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/5177"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5005"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
