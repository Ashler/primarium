It follows a three-step approach comprising basic, precursive, and cursive styles. Nelson Handwriting was developed by Alexander Inglis, Edward H. Gibson, and Douglas M. McIntosh in 1962, reformulated in 1984 for Thomas Nelson and Sons, and updated once again in 1997. Today it is published by the Oxford University Press.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1266\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/England_Nelson-Handwriting_pangram.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5483\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From preschool to second grade (4\u20137 years old), students are taught the unjoined style. Third and fourth grade students (7\u20139 years old) first learn precursive letters with lead-out strokes, and then, the semi-joined style, where most lowercase letters are connected, but uppercase ones are not. The letters are based on oval shapes, and can be upright or slanted in the last stage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was one of the most prevalent methods of handwriting teaching in the UK in the 20th century where it is still widely used. Nelson Handwriting has also influenced instruction in former colonies, such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Nigeria.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"3699\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/infographic-England_nelson-handwriting.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5486\"\/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":5484,"template":"","acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/models\/5482"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/models"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/models"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/5484"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5482"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
