In 2016, they identified the opportunity to develop their own model for teaching handwriting, which would meet the guidelines of the 2014 English curriculum. To this end, they hired TypeTogether to develop Twinkl Sans, a custom font for the composition of texts for children&#8217;s reading, and in 2017, a cursive font project, based on Twinkl Sans, was initiated. Twinkl Cursive was made for designing resources for teaching handwriting, and usage by teachers for the preparation of literacy materials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"557\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Twinkl-Cursive-1024x557.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5493\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Twinkl-Cursive-1024x557.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Twinkl-Cursive-300x163.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Twinkl-Cursive-768x417.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Twinkl-Cursive.webp 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Sample of Twinkl cursive looped style variations.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeking to serve both schools that adopted fully joined or semi-connected modern cursive approaches, the Twinkl Cursive family features two styles, Unlooped and Looped.
