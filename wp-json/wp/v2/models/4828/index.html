Lowercase letters are built on the foundation of a slanted oval, have slightly tall ascenders, and are semi-joined in their cursive style. The design resolves the conflicting recommendations about diagonal joins to letters with ascenders like k, l, f and t in <em>Teaching Handwriting<\/em> by replicating what is shown in samples, rather than following the written description. As a result, the design features these joins. The uppercase letters are in the style of simplified print script.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"4037\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/NewZealand_nz-handwriting-style-1.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4836\"\/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":4829,"template":"","acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/models\/4828"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/models"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/models"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/4829"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pr.ashler.design\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4828"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
